I am a healer, working with Hospice. I am inspired to drink life up, understanding that there is a finite amount of life to be had. I love to travel. My last amazing journey was to the Amazon. Even more memorable than the visual aspects of that trip were the auditory surprises. In addition to the contant vibrational buzzing and hissing in the air, I have 2 words for you, especially if you get to the Amazon: ""Howler Monkeys"". They truly sound like I imagine dinosaurs would sound. Apparently they get such volume and monster howl from a hole in a bone in their throats. Must be heard to be believed. But I digress! I'm a weekly dancer, pulling out the boots for two step, the retro wear for East Coast swing, and I waltz every chance I get no matter what I'm wearing. I love beautiful found objects. I write poetry and short stories. I have a private psychotherapy practice and teach mindfulness to people who are interested in more resiliency, more ZEST!  But I bet if you talked to my friends, they'd note the overall goofy, delighted way I like to carry on with life in general. As Helen Keller said, ""Life is a banquet, but most of us are starving to death."" So I invite you to come to my home and take a big bite out of life. The time is now.

In my spare time I like to read philosophy, history, and literature.  As well, I enjoy hiking and camping.  I used to work as a freelance travel writer for three years, so I have visited many foreign countries.  I first became an Airbnb user back in 2012, and eventually I became a host as well. Since 2012 I have hosted over 300 travelers from more than 35 countries at my house.  However, several things prompted me to delete my previous profile and relaunch my site in late 2014.  Therefore, I have hosted a lot more people than it appears on my profile.

I grew up in California, have a BA in Biology from Revelle (UCSD). I spent 2+ years studying pharmacology in graduate school at UCI, and 2+ years studying electronics at DeVry, but have never worked in either field. The last paid work I did was tutoring calculus. 
My politics are liberal and I don't believe cannabis, alcohol and drugs are inherently evil. I do believe in evidence-based (scientific) thinking, women's rights, saving habitats for non-human species (thereby our own as well), and recycling. So, not a typical Alabaman. I live here because my better half has a job here that he really likes. His name is Jim, and I am literally (yes, I know what literal means) grateful on a daily basis that I had the good sense to marry him. We usually read two or three books a week. For Friday night excitement, we go to Barnes & Noble where I peruse the paranormal romances, fantasy and sci-fi sections while he looks at sci-fi and nonfiction. My favorite is the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series by Laurell Hamilton. My dream job would be an editor for a publisher's paranormal romance division, because that genre desperately needs editing, and I am a spelling and grammar nazi. Don't ever give me a sample of your writing to proof unless you have a strong ego. 
I have a fondness for Siamese cats (one in particular), but enjoy all mammals. In 2014, a nerve in my heart died, so now I have a pacemaker. I didn't have a heart attack, but a tibial injury in 2008 keeps me from biking or taking extended walks. For exercise, I restrain myself from criticizing other people's bad grammar and misspellings. 
I like to travel, camp in national parks, try new restaurants and review them on Yelp!, repair broken things, and solve sudoku and kenken puzzles. When I travel, I like to leave no trace of my having been there... other than the occasional repaired lamp. I don't use any social media. Instead I call, e-mail, and text.

The eponymous lakes (one dedicated to fishing and one dedicated to swimming and boating) have dried up. The fishing lake was stocked with trout, bass and catfish.

Advertisements showed a water skier on the lake (which was probably no more than 5 feet deep) and a showcase home on the top of the nearby hill, giving the impression of a resort town. There was a country club and a high-end restaurant that overlooked the large recreational lake. There was also a small store/bar and grill.

My favorite things to do is cooking (Sze Chuan style as I am from Chong Qing), shopping, movies, meditation and laughing. I am a full-time house wife with a small business in trading on the side.  My husband retired a few years ago but he prefers to occupy his time by driving rideshare full-time.  My 20-year-old son is attending college.  

I look forward to meeting you.

我的朋友经常形容我是一个热情和值得信赖的人。 诚然，我的座右铭是“感恩生命，善待他人”。 我希望能够通过AirBnB这个平台接待来自世界各地的朋友。
我最喜欢做的事情是烹饪（我老家的重庆口味），购物，电影，冥想和笑。 我是个全职的家庭主妇，兼职一点小生意。 我的丈夫两年前退休了，但他还是喜欢全职驾车打发时间。 我20岁的儿子正在上大学。

I have lived in New York City all my life, and have lived at my current place for two years.. I am a student in Environmental Science and play music in two bands around Brooklyn, one for children (for example birthday parties for 5 year olds) and one rock and roll band, but I don't drink or smoke (don't mind other people who do)... I read alot of books and listen to alot of radio shows about science and international news- I ride my bike everywhere. If you stay at my house I will try and find you a bike!

I've travelled a little bit, to Europe (Sweden, Slovenia, Spain, France, Holland, Belgium, Germany), and to Mexico (D.F. mostly) and Israel but haven't left ny in the past few years. 
In the summer I try to go to the beach as much as possible. In the winter I visit friend's houses and drink tea. One day I would like to visit Africa, South America, the Artic and Papua New Guinea, (if I can ever save the money for the airline ticket :)  )
I can't live without books, friends, going for a walk once a day, trying to learn other languages (speak spanish, working on french, have taken classes in Greek, Japanese, Hebrew and Portuguese), and my family (they live in San Francisco)..

Our house is medium sized, but it has plenty of space for privacy, if you need your space after a long trip-  or for hanging out- we have a projector sometimes watch movies or listen to records in the living room- As far as hosting goes, I love New York and have many friends involved in all sides of it, from the arts/ music scenes to restaurants to activism- I know most neighborhoods in the city pretty well and am always happy to give people advice on where to go and what to do so they don't just see the stuff everyone sees. 

嗨喽，我叫Jacques，（我不会讲中文，这个介绍是我的一个房客帮我翻译的）

我住在布鲁克林（Brooklyn）一个安全的街区。我有两个房间，一大一小。我的公寓附近有一些酒吧和餐厅，离威廉斯堡（Williamsburg）和劳德代尔堡（Fort Green）比较近。去曼哈顿下城区（Lower Manhattan）的话半小时就到了。

我是个玩音乐的土生土长的纽约客。我有个25岁的开服饰店的室友Cat。我们支持多元性取向人权并为LGBT友好。房子里很安静，偶尔有时候我朋友们会过来一起看电影听音乐。

公寓里有无线网，厨房，浴室，浴巾，房间里有个大床和换洗的床单被套。超市和洗衣店都与公寓只隔着一条街。你会有你自己的钥匙。房间适合两人住但是有一次招待房客四个人也挤下来了。

规则

唯一一条规则就是禁止抽烟，嗑药，宠物和来过夜的房客外的人。务必不要把吃的放在厨房的桌子上。出门的时候一定要用钥匙锁门（门不能自动锁）。退房的时候在门外把钥匙从大门中间的小凿丢进门里面就好了。",within a day,67%,0%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1530310/profile_pic/1324663668/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1530310/profile_pic/1324663668/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Bedford-Stuyvesant,4.0,4.0,t,t,,Bedford-Stuyvesant,40.68877,-73.95408,Private room in rental unit,Private room,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,"[""Fire extinguisher"", ""Kitchen"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Host greets you"", ""Hot water"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""First aid kit"", ""Wifi"", ""Essentials"", ""Heating"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Private entrance"", ""Shampoo""]",35.0,30,250,30.0,t,36,0,0,67,0,0,0.0,2014-06-01,2020-04-01,4.75,4.64,3.81,4.92,4.92,4.83,4.67,f,4,0,4,0,0.27

The infusion of life that has come from Columbia University's campus expansion, seismic decrease in violent crime, and the explosion of the restaurant and nightlife scene has made this neighborhood THE coveted place following the trends of Hell's Kitchen and Williamsburg.
